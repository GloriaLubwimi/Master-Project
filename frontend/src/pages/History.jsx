                    Patmos started as a prayer group, where we prayed at first in (Lingala), because that is the common language for us. We originally come from Angola and Congo (Ex Zaire). <br/>
                    How were the thoughts born? , as we see it, began like this: in 1992, a compatriot of ours died here in Stockholm after a failed operation. He was young and a new father <br/> in the new country. 
                    During the tragic sad period the thoughts came, it is extremely important to be able to meet to pray for each other during this time. The Bible says,<br/> our thoughts are not God's 
                    thoughts and not the other way around either. This would give us the opportunity to strengthen our civil society here in Sweden and especially <br/> in the great city of Stockholm,
                    because everyone knew Christian traditions from home. Some of us were in different congregations around Stockholm not as active <br/> members but as passive believers, this was mainly due to language difficulties.
                    We had different Christian backgrounds, so we belonged to different denominations, <br/> movements, etc. But the purpose was not to discuss about the church community, whatever it is called, but to pray and read the Bible together.
                    This united us all, but it was not<br/> without effort. 15.05.1993 the first meeting of the group was held, because the group was so small we held our meetings in homes.

                    The number of participants increased with each meeting we had, therefore the group could not continue to have its meetings in the home. Then the need arose to borrow a <br/> room in a church. Why would we have our premises in a church? Well, 
                    because right from the start we wanted to show that our meetings would only be about Christianity <br/> and nothing else. Those meetings would be non-political and would not have any commercial purposes. This is because there were already associations with different 
                    purposes among people from Angola and the Congo. We got to use a venue in Filadelfia in Spånga, this was in 1993. During that time, the group became known primarily among fellow countrymen, including people from other countries.

                <p className='history-text2'>
                20.09.1998 we moved to Högdalen church premises, the church belongs to the Missionary Union. The reason for the move was that Spånga was no longer suitable, <br/>
                that there was not enough space for children's activities. In Högdalen we got the name Patmos, why? 
                Well, in Spånga we were a prayer group, but the more time went by <br/> the more we came to resemble a congregation. Therefore, the move to Högdalen was a good opportunity to start as a congregation. In our first management meeting we <br/>
                decided to give the parish a name, 
                this was done by drawing lots of those present and the name became Patmos. But since we are called the African Christian Association <br/>in the register, we have to change and we did this by writing to the Tax Authority, but we have not yet received an answer.
                24.09.2000 we moved from Högdalen to the Bredäng Pentecostal church, this because the Patmos parish became part of the Filadelfia parish. Both Patmos and Bredäng Pentecostal churches belong to Filadelfia.
